To change the fanfare being played, use the "Set jingle" menu in GreaseMonkey.  
You can either set an URL to a valid MP3 file, or provide b64 encoded audio data.  
*b64 encoded data MUST begin with `data:audio/type;base64`.

To encode b64 data, use [this tool](https://base64.guru/converter/encode/audio) and select `Data URI` as the output format.

*By default the Zelda BotW "Key Item" fanfare is played.
